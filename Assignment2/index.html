    <hr>
    <div>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="bodytext">Waste is a
        product of our lives. It is a waste product that has lost its use value and cannot be used, it is an
        important part of material recycling. In some big cities, some type of waste disposal is a problem, for example,
        <strong>plastic</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytext">
        The common way is to collect and send the waste for landfill disposal, or to incinerate them in
        incinerators. But both create environmental concerns. Waste disposal in landfills pollutes groundwater and emits
        odors, and in many cities there
        is less space available for landfills. And incineration inevitably produces toxic gases .

    <h2 class="subtitle" style="padding-top: 30px;"> Municipal Waste Generate and Treat</h2>
    <div class="bobyvis">
      <div style="width: 30%; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 10px;text-align: left;">
        <p class="bodytext">First of all, let's see some better manage waste data in the world. The graph on the right
          shows the data of municipal waste production and disposal in various
          countries of the world from 2010 to 2018. These municipal wastes include household and similar waste, bulky
          waste and electric and electronic equipment waste. Most of these wastes are treated with recycling,
          incineration energy recovery and landfill.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The data of some countries were not recorded in the early stage, so the generate/treat of
          some countries' municipal wastes will be missing. But it is not difficult to see that only a small number of
          countries'
          municipal waste has not been completely treated. <strong> Which means these municipal wastes are
            managed as almost all of them can be handled effectively</strong>.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2 class="subtitle" style="padding-top: 30px;"> Plastic Waste</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">What about plastic waste? Is it been treated or recovery? The map below shows the world's
      plastic waste production in 2010.
      These limited figures add up to more than 270 million tons. But can so much plastic waste be effectively treated?
      The three main types of plastic waste disposal are shown in the area chart below. It can be seen that with the
      beginning of 1980, the disposal of discarded plastic waste has decreased, and the recycled and incinerated have
      increased. But until 2015, <strong> up to 55% of plastic waste was still using discarded disposal</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle" style="padding-top: 30px;"> Per capita Plastic Waste vs GDP in 2010</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">The bubble chart below shows the population, GDP and per capita plastic waste production by
      country in 2019.
      It can be seen from the figure that the GDP and per capita production of plastic waste in countries with large
      populations are not high. <strong> Countries with high GDP also have high production per capita. Seen like
        population
        is not the main cause of the large amount of plastic waste</strong>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Kuwait has the higest per capita plastic waste (kg) per person per day. And Macao has the
      highest GDP per capita per person</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle" style="padding-top: 30px;"> Marine debris</h2>
    <div class="bobyvis">
      <div style="width: 40%; padding-right: 50px; text-align: left;">
        <p class="bodytext">So what to do with the discarded plastic waste? This discarded waste will send to the ocean
          and
          becomes marine debris. Plastics are difficult to biodegrade and form an important part of marine debris. Some
          of
          these human-made and refining wastes stay on the beach, and some float on the ocean surface or
          sink
          to the ocean.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The map on the right shows the percentage of plastic waste the world sends to the ocean. It
          can be seen that although countries with high GDP such as the United States and Germany are relatively ahead
          in the production of plastic waste, the rate of emitted plastic waste to the ocean is indeed very low. But
          this is <strong> not because these countries have good waste disposal technology, they export waste to
            other countries, specialy Asian countries</strong>, such as China. However, China has stopped accepting
          plastic waste imports since 2017.</p>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p class="bodytext">Marine debris is poisoning the ocean and the species that live
        rely on ocean. Many news reports of marine life deaths, starvation and drowning due to accidental
        ingestion of plastic debris. The most common types of plastic waste in the ocean are listed in the radial plot
        on the left. And this plastic waste will also end
        up in the seafood we eat and hide in our body.</p>

      <strong>The bags (14.06% of the total waste found) are the most common waste found in the ocean and river</strong>
      ,
      while plastic bottles are the second most waste (11.89%). Drink canns were not found that common, ranking last
      (3.17%)
      in the top 10 most common waste find in river and ocean.

    <h2 class="subtitle" style="padding-top: 30px;">Marine Debris Decomposition Time</h2>
    <div class="bobyvis">
      <div style="width: 50%; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 10px;text-align: left;">
        <p class="bodytext">It takes many years for this marine debris to decomposition into the ocean. The graph on the
          right
          shows how long it takes for some of the most common marine debris to decomposition in the ocean. The fishing
          lines
          taking the longest to decomposition, which is <strong>600 years</strong>. The decomposition time of plastic
          bottle, disposable
          diaper
          and plastic beverage also <strong>hold longer than 400 years</strong>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">A large amount of marine debris has accumulated because it
          takes too long to decompose. The marine debris in the Pacific Ocean alone has reached more than 3 million
          square kilometers, even more than the land area of India. A huge plastic-dominated "garbage patch" has
          formed in the Pacific Ocean. If we don't do somthing, the oceans will no longer be able to keep up with the
          vast amount of marine debris, and we are not gointg to survive either if we lost our ocean. We should
          strengthen public awareness of environmental protection and reduce the use of plastics and single-use products
          as much as possible.</p>
